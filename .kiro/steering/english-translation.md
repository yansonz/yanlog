# English Translation Guidelines

## Goal
Translate Korean content to English in a natural, human-like style that avoids AI-generated writing patterns.

## Core Principles

### 1. Write Like a Human
- Use conversational, natural language
- Vary sentence structure and length
- Include personal voice and perspective
- Use contractions where appropriate (I'm, don't, can't)
- Show personality and emotion

### 2. Avoid AI Red Flag Words

**Important Note:** These are guidelines, not absolute rules. If a word or phrase serves a specific purpose or is genuinely the best choice for the context, use it. The goal is to avoid overuse and unnatural patterns, not to eliminate these words entirely.

**Overly Formal Words (Use Sparingly):**
- ❌ Delve / Dive in → ✅ Explore, look at, examine
- ❌ Tapestry / A tapestry of → ✅ Mix, collection, variety
- ❌ Treasure trove → ✅ Collection, set, bunch
- ❌ Testament → ✅ Proof, example, sign
- ❌ Peril → ✅ Risk, danger, problem
- ❌ Landscape (metaphorical) → ✅ Field, area, space
- ❌ Comprehensive → ✅ Complete, full, thorough
- ❌ Fascinating → ✅ Interesting, cool, neat

**Overused Transition Phrases:**
- ❌ "It is important to note that..."
- ❌ "In conclusion, it can be said that..."
- ❌ "At the end of the day..."
- ❌ "This comprehensive guide will..."
- ❌ "It is worth noting..."
- ❌ "One might argue..."
- ❌ "It could be said..."

**Better Alternatives:**
- ✅ Start directly with the point
- ✅ Use simple transitions: "Also," "Plus," "And," "But"
- ✅ Skip unnecessary hedging

### 3. Avoid AI Punctuation Patterns

**Em Dashes (—):**
- AI overuses em dashes for parenthetical information
- ❌ "The character—Kiro wearing a hat—was created..."
- ✅ "The character (Kiro wearing a hat) was created..."
- ✅ "The character, Kiro wearing a hat, was created..."

**Semicolons:**
- Use sparingly; most people don't use them in casual writing
- Prefer periods or commas

### 4. Sentence Structure

**Vary Your Patterns:**
- Mix short and long sentences
- Don't always start with subject-verb
- Use fragments occasionally for emphasis
- Break "rules" when it sounds natural

**Example:**
- ❌ AI: "The project was initiated with the goal of creating a comprehensive solution. It was designed to address multiple challenges. The implementation phase began immediately."
- ✅ Human: "We started the project to solve several problems at once. Implementation? We jumped right in."

### 5. Word Choice

**Prefer Simple Over Complex:**
- ❌ Utilize → ✅ Use
- ❌ Commence → ✅ Start, begin
- ❌ Endeavor → ✅ Try, attempt
- ❌ Facilitate → ✅ Help, make easier
- ❌ Implement → ✅ Add, build, create
- ❌ Leverage → ✅ Use, take advantage of

**Be Specific:**
- ❌ "Various tools" → ✅ "Mac Preview and Google Slides"
- ❌ "Multiple characters" → ✅ "9 characters"
- ❌ "Significant impact" → ✅ "Cut load time by 90%"

### 6. Cultural Context

**For Korean → English Translation:**
- Explain Korean cultural references naturally
- Don't over-explain; assume intelligent readers
- Use parenthetical notes for names: "Gatssn Kiro (갓쓴키로)"
- Provide brief context: "gat, a traditional Korean hat"

### 7. Tone and Voice

**Maintain Personality:**
- Keep humor and casual asides
- Preserve rhetorical questions
- Include personal anecdotes
- Show enthusiasm or skepticism naturally

**Example:**
- ❌ AI: "The implementation was successful and yielded positive results."
- ✅ Human: "It worked! Better than I expected, actually."

## Translation Checklist

Before finalizing English translation:

- [ ] Read it aloud - does it sound natural?
- [ ] Check for AI red flag words (but keep them if they serve a purpose)
- [ ] Vary sentence length and structure
- [ ] Remove unnecessary hedging phrases
- [ ] Replace em dashes with parentheses or commas (unless intentional)
- [ ] Use contractions where natural
- [ ] Keep the author's voice and personality
- [ ] Ensure cultural references are clear but not over-explained
- [ ] Prefer simple words over complex ones (unless complexity adds value)
- [ ] Check that it doesn't sound like a textbook

**Remember:** The goal is natural, human-like writing, not avoiding specific words at all costs. Context and intent matter more than rigid rules.

## Examples

### ❌ AI-Style Translation:
"It is important to note that the comprehensive implementation of this fascinating project was undertaken with the goal of delving into the landscape of developer personalities. The tapestry of characters—each representing unique traits—serves as a testament to the diverse nature of the field."

### ✅ Human-Style Translation:
"I built this project to explore different developer personalities. Each character represents a unique type, showing just how diverse developers can be."
