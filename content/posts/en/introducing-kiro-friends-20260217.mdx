## Background

When preparing for the Kiro Korea User Group, I thought it would be great to have a representative character for the community, just like AWS Korea User Group has [Gurumi](https://github.com/awskrug/awskrug-digital-assets/blob/master/gurumi/gurumi_TP.png). While my design skills were limited to Mac Preview's markup toolbar and Google Slides, I was able to easily create the 'Gatssn Kiro' character (Kiro wearing a traditional Korean hat called gat) using Gemini's image generation model. When I met Jiyeon, who created Kiro keychains for the Kiro launch party merchandise, and showed her the Gatssn Kiro character, she revealed that she had designed 9 additional characters for future merchandise.

On the first day of Korea's long Lunar New Year holiday, I worked with Kiro to match each character with developer work styles and created a service that analyzes developer types through a series of questions. I named the collection of Gatssn Kiro and the 9 additional characters (10 characters in total) 'Kiro Friends'. Below are the key considerations during development and character introductions.

## Key Considerations
- Questions were designed to be completed within 1-2 minutes, keeping them as short and simple as possible. The quiz consists of 4 style axes: the first 8 questions establish the basic combination of each axis, and the additional 8 questions provide supplementary information to determine the final character.
- To avoid complexity in question composition and selection logic, the goal was to minimize duplicate combinations, but this was unavoidable with the constraint of 10 characters. (Reducing the number of characters would have simplified the logic, but how could I not use all these adorable characters?)
- Beyond fun and viral elements on the results page, I included Kiro usage tips tailored to developer tendencies to spark interest in Kiro, and the bottom CTA area provides access to AWS community-related information.
- The service supports Korean, English, and Japanese, with language-specific links: Korean users see the AWS Summit 2026 Community Track speaker application page, Japanese users see the AWS JAWS Day 2026 registration page, and English users see the AWS Summit 2026 regional schedule page.

## Future Plans
I routinely added basic logging to track service traffic and conversion performance, connecting it to Amplitude. After sharing in Kiro-related community channels, I plan to monitor the results, though I have no experience or know-how with viral services, so I have no sense of expectations and don't have high hopes. However, it was an enjoyable experience to gauge the design and development capabilities of Kiro + Claude Opus 4.6 model and work with these adorable characters.
